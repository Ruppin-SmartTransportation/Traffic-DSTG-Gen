# Traffic-DSTG-Gen
Traffic-DSTG-Gen is a flexible, open-source tool for generating dynamic, spatio-temporal graph datasets from traffic simulations. Designed to support advanced traffic prediction research, it converts vehicle and junction movements captured via traffic simulators into richly-structured graphs compatible with modern machine learning frameworks.
