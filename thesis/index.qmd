# Introduction

Urbanization and the rapid expansion of global transportation networks have intensified the challenges cities face regarding traffic congestion, environmental sustainability, and efficient mobility management. Traffic congestion undermines not only daily commuter experience but also the reliability of logistics, public transit, and emergency services. In addition to economic costs, congestion significantly contributes to environmental degradation. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the transportation sector accounted for approximately 24% of global CO₂ emissions in 2022, with road traffic being the primary contributor [@IEA2022Transport]., with road traffic being the primary contributor. Prolonged idling, stop-and-go traffic, and increased fuel consumption in congested areas exacerbate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, affecting both public health and climate targets. These challenges underscore the importance of accurate and proactive traffic forecasting, which has become a foundational requirement for smart city infrastructure—supporting real-time navigation services, adaptive traffic control systems, and long-term urban policy planning. In addition to its environmental implications, traffic congestion imposes a substantial economic burden. According to a 2022 report by INRIX, traffic congestion cost U.S. drivers approximately $81 billion annually in lost productivity and fuel waste, with the average commuter losing 51 hours per year in traffic [@INRIX2022Report]. $81 billion annually in lost productivity and fuel waste, with the average commuter losing 51 hours per year in traffic. These economic losses further reinforce the necessity for predictive traffic systems that can mitigate congestion before it escalates into measurable cost.

While the next chapter provides a more in-depth review of traffic prediction systems, we begin here by highlighting foundational concepts to contextualize our approach.

Contemporary commercial applications, such as Google Maps [@GoogleMaps] and Waze [@Laor2022], represent practical extensions of classical routing algorithms, incorporating live traffic data, incident reports, and crowd-sourced feedback. These systems build on the foundations of algorithms like Dijkstra’s by integrating dynamic edge weights that reflect current traffic conditions [@dijkstra1959]. However, despite these improvements, they remain largely reactive: routing decisions are based on current or very recent traffic states, with limited capability to anticipate future congestion trends.  

The introduction of deep learning—especially Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs)—has significantly advanced the state of traffic prediction by enabling models to jointly learn spatial and temporal patterns over graph-structured data. These networks conceptualize road systems as graphs, where nodes represent physical entities such as intersections or sensors, and edges denote traffic flow or connectivity. Numerous deep learning models leveraging this approach have achieved strong predictive accuracy on standard benchmarks, consistently delivering state-of-the-art (SOTA) results and demonstrating substantial improvements over classical time-series methods. However, many of these models rely on fixed sensor-based graphs and lack mechanisms for adapting to vehicle-level dynamics or responding to the real-time evolution of road conditions and user behavior. As a result, while these models excel in controlled benchmarking settings, their real-time predictive accuracy often diminishes when deployed in complex, dynamic urban environments. They struggle to incorporate user-specific behavior or to respond adaptively to unexpected events such as road closures, congestion spikes, or evolving mobility patterns [@li2018].

Recognizing that traffic networks are dynamic systems shaped by human behavior, road incidents, and infrastructure changes, we propose a paradigm shift toward future-aware traffic forecasting. Building on the limitations of current deep learning approaches, this perspective emphasizes not only capturing the present state of the network but also anticipating how traffic conditions will evolve as users continue their journeys. The capacity to predict downstream conditions based on current trends and individual travel behavior is central to the improved accuracy and utility of next-generation traffic forecasting systems.

To address these challenges, our framework introduces a dynamic graph representation that models both vehicles and junctions as nodes, updated in real time using GPS-based vehicle location data and user-declared destinations. This enables the system to project future vehicle positions, model interdependencies among travelers, and forecast congestion along anticipated paths [@voloch2021]. By embedding route intent and trajectory-aware reasoning into the graph structure, the model accounts for user-specific routing behavior, enhancing its ability to anticipate downstream conditions.

In benchmark evaluations, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art STGNN-based models, achieving lower prediction errors across multiple time horizons and exhibiting greater robustness in real-time, dynamic traffic environments. These improvements translate into more accurate travel-time estimations, more reliable route recommendations, and a better foundation for congestion mitigation strategies in intelligent transportation systems.

The key contributions of this work are as follows:

First, we propose a novel **dynamic spatio-temporal graph model** that evolves in real time by incorporating both mobile vehicles and static junctions as heterogeneous nodes. The edge structure reflects current road usage and routing intent. This enables the model to support personalized forecasting and adaptive reasoning across both user trajectories and urban infrastructure.

Second, we integrate **user-declared destinations** into the prediction pipeline. This allows the model to forecast downstream congestion and anticipate traffic load along projected travel paths, improving the granularity and relevance of predictions.

Third, we design a unified architecture that combines **graph convolutional networks (GCNs)** for spatial learning, **recurrent layers** (GRU or LSTM) for temporal reasoning, and **destination-aware embeddings** for intent modeling. This synergy improves the model’s ability to capture complex traffic dynamics and individual behavior.

Finally, we propose an evaluation framework using both synthetic (SUMO) and real-world datasets to benchmark the model's predictive performance, adaptability, and robustness. Compared to established baselines such as DCRNN, STGCN, and TrafficPredict, our method demonstrates superior accuracy and generalization across diverse traffic scenarios.
